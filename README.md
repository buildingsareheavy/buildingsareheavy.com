# Buildings Are Heavy: Professional Website (New)

[Buildings Are Heavy](https://buildingsareheavy.com) is built using [Gatsby(v2)](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator.

---

The objective was to combine my professional portfolio and information with my personal blog to give a more holistic view of who I am, as well as what I do.
