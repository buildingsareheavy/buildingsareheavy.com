<p>
A client website, I was tasked to create consistent branding with hundreds of store items, as well as curate featured collections of work that was both for sale and on display as fine art.

<p>
Artists Franky + Annie Scaglione established "My Favourite Colour Studio" to honor and capture the aesthetics of nostalgia. From baseball to cross-country road trips, their inspirations and passion overlap in the preservation of our rich pastimes, celebrating all things classic.
</p>

<p class="italic">"Right To Roam" is an example of a featured collection. </p>
