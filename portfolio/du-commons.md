A microsite built in Wordress, I was tasked to create an interactive website that was also maintainable by "University of Denver" staff. I handcoded the site using HTML, SCSS, PHP, and JavaScript to have a consistent experience with campus computers that use older browsers including Internet Explorer.

"The University of Denver" is a private research university in Denver, Colorado. Founded in 1864, it is the oldest independent private university in the Rocky Mountain Region of the United States.
