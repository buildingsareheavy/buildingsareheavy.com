A client website, built in Wordpress, with an intuitive backend for employees to update, and post to the blog. I was asked to capture and reflect the subtle and contemporary aesthetics of MCA Denver.

<p>
"The Museum of Contemporary Art Denver" (MCA Denver) created "Animating Museums" to further cultivate the creativity of already creative people working in art museums. Fourteen fellows from art museums across the United States have been selected for the two-year program, which includes residency workshops in Denver, ongoing mentorship, and a group project.
